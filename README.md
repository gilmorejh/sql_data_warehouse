# Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project

This repository showcases a **modern data warehouse** and analytics solution built with SQL Server.  
It highlights industry best practices in **data engineering**, **ETL development**, **data modeling**, and **analytics** — making it an ideal portfolio project for aspiring data professionals.

---

## Data Architecture

The project uses a **Medallion Architecture**:

1. **Bronze Layer** – Raw data ingestion from source systems (CSV → SQL Server).
2. **Silver Layer** – Cleansing, standardization, and normalization for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer** – Business-ready star schema for reporting and analytics.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Data Architecture:** Building a modern warehouse using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Extract, transform, and load data from ERP and CRM sources.
- **Data Modeling:** Designing dimension and fact tables optimized for analytics.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Producing SQL reports and dashboards for business insights.
